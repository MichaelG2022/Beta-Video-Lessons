	/*What is a Collection?  Think of a Collection as an Object, but that Object can contain (or represent) a group of Objects.  Java provides a Collection Framework, which is an architecture that allows a unified access to a variety of different collections.  You have already been introduced to Lists, and it was mentioned that a List an Interface that falls within the Collections Framework.  Two additional types of Collection Interfaces are Sets and Maps.  

	Collection Interfaces:  Set, List, Map, and others

	Collection Implementations:  There are a number of classes provided in Java that are used to implement the Collection Interfaces.   See the Java Collections Framework Overview link below for additional information on Collection Implementations.

			Interface --> Implementation
			----------------------------
			Set --> HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet
			List --> ArrayList, LinkedList
			Map --> HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap

	The Collections Class:  

		The Collections Class contains static methods that either return collections, or perform some operation on collections.
		A NullPointerException is thrown by all methods of this class if the collections or Class Objects provided are null.
		Check out the links below for information on the Java Class Collections.

		Set:
			No Duplicates
			At most one Null element
			Not guaranteed to be in any particular order

		Set Example:
			Notice the order of the Strings that are inserted into this Set.

	/*	What happens if you add a duplicate to a Set?
	 *	Questions to ask: 
	 *		1. Is an error thrown? 
	 *		2. Does the duplicate get stored?
